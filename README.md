# Predict-Lap-times
This project was aimed at trying to predict laptimes of f1 car during free practice which can reflect to race pace. More spefically i captured Lewis Hamiltons lap times and formed those times at my data set. Please note this wont be entirely accurate or close to real life as there are many factors to take into account
